### What is Monopoly GO?

Monopoly GO is a mobile version of the classic board game Monopoly, designed to provide a fresh and engaging experience for players on the go. In the game, players collect properties, buy houses and hotels, and roll dice to move around the board. But what sets Monopoly GO apart from traditional Monopoly is the use of **virtual dice** to determine the movement of your pieces, along with the opportunity to participate in events, challenges, and bonus rounds.

Like the original game, your goal is to build an empire, bankrupt your opponents, and collect as many properties as you can. However, the mobile version introduces a fast-paced, competitive aspect, with online matches against friends and players from around the world. In addition to collecting dice, you can use **power-ups**, **boosts**, and **special events** to level up your progress.
